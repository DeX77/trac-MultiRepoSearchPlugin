Changelog
=========

0.6 (2013-01-15)
----------------

* The plugin's search source is now off by default, so Trac searches will not include
  source code results unless the user explicitly checks the "Source Repository" box
  on the search form.  This way the plugin won't impact performance of searches unless
  the user actually wants to search through source code.  (This behavior may change 
  in the future, but not until there exists a search backend that's faster than unindexed
  full text search on a database column.)

0.5 (2013-01-15)
----------------

* Selectively reindex only the files that were changed or added in each changeset, rather than
  reindexing the entire repository. (http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/9790)

0.4 (2013-01-11)
----------------

* Errors will no longer occur when repositories or files are removed from the underlying
   system but still referenced in the search backend's list of search results.
   (http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/9791, http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/10792, http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/10793)
* Removed broken index on text contents for new installations (http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/10619)

0.3 (2012-09-28)
----------------

* Search backends are now expected to match against filenames as well as file contents.
  The provided SQLIndexer component has been updated to search for filenames as well.
